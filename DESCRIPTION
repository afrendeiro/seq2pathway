Description: Seq2pathway is a novel tool for functional gene-set (or
        termed as pathway) analysis of next-generation sequencing data,
        consisting of "seq2gene" and "gene2path" components. The
        seq2gene links sequence-level measurements of genomic regions
        (including SNPs or point mutation coordinates) to gene-level
        scores, and the gene2pathway summarizes gene scores to
        pathway-scores for each sample. The seq2gene has the
        feasibility to assign both coding and non-exon regions to a
        broader range of neighboring genes than only the nearest one,
        thus facilitating the study of functional non-coding regions.
        The gene2pathway takes into account the quantity of
        significance for gene members within a pathway compared those
        outside a pathway. The output of seq2pathway is a general
        structure of quantitative pathway-level scores, thus allowing
        one to functional interpret such datasets as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq,
        GWAS, and derived from other next generational sequencing
        experiments.
